Dwell time- amount of time in your network undetected= undetected mean time of detection(average 200 days) + mean time of repair(average 70days) mtd + mtr average 56 days 
Endpoint-
EDR-endpoint detection and response happens after infection. Compromised of protection phase (50-60% accuracy)and detection phase(remaining 40-50%)
XDR- extended detection, SaaS based threat detection and incident response tool that combines security tools for comprehensive operations (Integration, analysis, response)
Normalization
Artificial Intelligence
MDR- managed detection and response. 24/7 monitoring, detection, and lightweight response services…leveraging a combination if techniques” Gartner. Security analytics, proactive threat hunting. Automated incident response using soar. 
NAV- network analysis and visibility tools
NTA- network traffic analysis tools
Managed EDR
MDR + in person response 
Signature-
Behavior- 
SOAR-
Preinfection- 50-60% accuracy and done by ML usually within Malware protection
Post infection- includes forensics
YARA rules
Meta data
Managed service provider- Msp

SOAR

Key terms: 




Hack-



Incident response-



Mean time to detect-avg 200 days. The time between when the attack occurs and when we become aware of the attack

Mean time to resolution- avg 70 days


Reconnaissance-observing for weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the context of an incident. Typical Initial step for a bad actor 


Boom-when the attack occurs


Threat hunting- reduces mean time to response 

XDR-

Siem-

Zero days-

Dynamic playbook- 

Black swan-



Intro:

	◦	“Fire! Fire! Fire!” Is what I would yell while running for my life if I was in an actual fire(probably should add in a couple high pitched, terrified yelps for help). But I’ll admit i’ve never experienced a home catching fire before. However, I can imagine. I can imagine the helpless feeling. I can imagine the hopeful resignation as I’m forced to wait desperately on the sound of that blaring firetruck’s sirens. I can imagine the relief washing over me as someone wearing a red hat and a yellow jacket arrive to save me and my belongings from imminent doom.  Someone with equipment. And powerful equipment. That’s how understand SOAR. In this analogy the fire truck, with it’s ability to pump incredible amounts of water, is like SOAR. Once attached to a water source, or in the case of SOAR, heaps of security data, the system can be deftly handled by a fireman (or in our case a incident response analyst) to subdue the worst of fires(security breaches).
